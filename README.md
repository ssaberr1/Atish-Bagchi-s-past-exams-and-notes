# Atish-Bagchi-s-past-exams-and-notes
An archive of Atish Bagchi's notes and past exams for future students.

Hopefully this will help students who are taking the class in Fall 2020 and beyond.



I also ask if you spot any errors in past exams or notes please bring it up with Professor Bagchi. I'll update the github as directed from professor.



I (Sheila) will not be able to help you in solving any problems this year, but if you are having technical difficulties please reach out at ssaberr1@temple.edu 



Thanks and good luck.
