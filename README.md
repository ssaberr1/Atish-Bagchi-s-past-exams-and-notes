# Atish-Bagchi-s-past-exams-and-notes
An archive of Atish Bagchi's notes and past exams for future students.

Hopefully this will help students who are taking the class in Fall 2020 and beyond.



I also ask if you spot any errors in past exams or notes discuss amongst yourselfs and please bring it up with Professor Bagchi. You can either forward me the new updated notes or add to the github yourselves.


I (Sheila) will not be able to help you in solving any problems this year, but if you are having technical difficulties please reach out at ssaberr1@temple.edu 



Thanks and good luck.
